# Session Log

## 2026-04-16 — Session 166
- Added pixel art silhouettes for all 7 previously-missing items in both `drawEquipment()` pegboard cards and `_drawShopItemIcon()` shop preview: Photo Camera, Salt, Firelight, Sound Sensor, Motion Sensor, Head Gear, Parabolic Microphone
- Added Firelight and Parabolic Microphone to TRUCK_CATALOG, SHOP_CATALOG, and ITEM_MAX_QTY so they can be added/removed from the pre-game truck loadout tab
- All items on the pegboard are pickupable via the existing click handler (no logic change needed)
- Van pegboard (equipmentList) automatically reflects whatever was loaded in the pre-game TRUCK tab via `_roundLoadout` → `equipmentList` at game start

## 2026-04-16 — Session 165
- Flashlight distance falloff: fog gradient now starts dimming at 24px world (was 135px); aggressive stops ensure visible near/far difference even in small rooms
- UV light: removed `_uvDark` overlay that was darkening already-lit areas; fixed premultiplied-alpha edge artifact by using same hue at zero-alpha for terminal gradient stop
- Video camera blur: downscale-blur approach (1/4 res → blur → upscale) replaces full-canvas blur — ~16× cheaper; fixed `destination-in` composite mode not being reset across frames (caused blank blur from frame 2 onward)
- Camera static: noise dots + horizontal scan tears overlaid on blur; pre-allocated canvases prevent per-frame GC pressure
- Camera pixelation approach tried and reverted back to gaussian blur per user preference
- Photo camera and objectives HUD disabled (code kept, `&& false` guards); video camera re-enabled for viewfinder/NV
- Persistent save: `localStorage` saves `_selectedChar`, `_layoutPresets`, `_layoutActive`, `_roundLoadout` on every mutation; restored on page load
- Door raycast light-leak fix: expanded door blocking rect by 8px along long axis in `_flRayDist` — covers the 6px gap between narrow door rect and wider doorway connector rect that was letting thin lines of light slip through on both sides of closed doors

## 2026-04-07 — Session 164
- Mode select cards: replaced placeholder photo areas with drawn scenes (lone investigator + flashlight for SP, 4 faded figures + "COMING SOON" stamp for MP, lit room + ghost book + arrow for Training)
- Difficulty selector moved from map page to investigator page
  - Removed full strip from `_drawPageMap`
  - Replaced summary badge on `_drawPageProfile` with compact `‹ / ›` arrow picker
  - Click handlers: arrows on page 2 cycle `_selectedDifficulty` ±1; removed old page-0 diff clicks
- Map polaroid, map name scrap, and van inventory shifted down 20px on investigator page

## 2026-04-07 — Session 163
- PixelLab walk animations fully wired for all 6 characters
  - Downloaded ZIPs for John, Chad, Tiffiny, Loren, Candy, Samuri → extracted to `sprites/characters/{name}/`
  - Pre-load walk frames at page startup (`_plWalkImgs` cache); `_applyCharSprites()` uses cache instead of creating new Images
  - `_applyCharSprites()` now called at game start (was only on photo-click — root bug causing no walk animation)
  - `_drawPlayerSprite` fallback: if walk frame not loaded, try idle frame before procedural art
  - Procedural pixel art character no longer appears when PixelLab char selected
- Motel (Gallow's Inn) improvements
  - All furniture removed from Map 1
  - Door frame markers: 5px bright `#c89448` trim drawn on BOTH sides of every door after room edges, so doors visible from both rooms
  - Red tint fixed: `sunrise`/`sunset` `bg` changed to neutral `#020205` (same as night); `fogColor` also neutralized; colored atmosphere only applies to outside directional light
- Tool readout HUD moved from screen-center to bottom-center above inventory arc
  - Thermometer, EMF Reader, Video Camera pills now anchor at `canvas.height - 30 - 24 - 52`, centered at `canvas.width/2`
- Bug fix: `_nearWI` → `nearWI` typo on bone proximity prompt line

## 2026-04-06 — Session 162
- Map 2 — Gallow's Inn: fully playable second map
  - `buildMap(id)` architecture: `_currentMapId` module-level var set from resolved `_mid`; all map data rebuilt each round
  - Map 1 layout: E-W hallway spine (y:340-390), 4 north rooms (Reception/101/102/Suite), 4 south rooms (Manager/103/104/Laundry), Storage, Lobby, Yard
  - Furniture: 40+ pieces across all rooms — beds, nightstands, dressers, TV stands, reception desk, key rack, washing machines, dryers, storage shelves, lobby benches + vending machines
  - Floor textures: hallway threadbare carpet runner, guestroom worn carpet strips, reception linoleum tiles, laundry/storage concrete tile, lobby checkered tile
  - Room edge highlights: `_RHL` made ternary — map-0 original 14-entry array vs map-1 11-entry array
  - Front door marker: `_fdx/_fdr/_fdcx` derived from `_currentMapId`; same dynamic variables for inside + outside view
  - Motel flat roof: tar-and-gravel texture, parapet rim, HVAC units, water tower, hallway spine visible on roof, south facade with windows + neon sign, front entrance
  - Fog light spill: `fDoor.label === "Front Entrance"` added to find clause; map-1 uses Lobby rect for spill area
  - Bone exclusion: `r.label !== "Lobby"` added alongside Foyer exclusion
  - Map name HUD: `_mapNameMap` updated with id 1 → "Gallow's Inn"

## 2026-04-05 — Session 161
- Phase 51 — Ghost LOS + speed rebalance
  - Replaced 350px distance check with room-identity check: `_roomAtPoint(ghost) === _roomAtPoint(player)` → `_hasLOS`
  - `_huntLastKnownX/Y`: seeded when hunt starts, updated each frame ghost has LOS; ghost chases stale coords when sight is lost
  - `ghostLastKnownRoom`: updated on LOS; ghost re-roams to it when hunt ends
  - Give-up: `huntLostSightTimer` reaches `_huntGiveUpTime` (8s normal, 4s when hiding) → `_endHunt()` fires
  - Speed: `huntSpeedBase 1.0 → 0.85` (search), `huntSpeedLOS 1.4 → 1.1` (chase); all per-ghost overrides scaled proportionally
  - Deogen exception: `always_knows_player_pos` → `_alwaysKnows` bypasses same-room check
  - Removed on-screen overlays: hunt text, presence flash badge, evidence notification overlays; ghost activity stays on minimap
  - Fixed game-freeze: `playerOutside` was `draw()`-local; duplicated `const` in `update()` → ReferenceError; fixed by adding it to `update()` scope
  - Fixed `isSprinting` ReferenceError: moved to module-level `let`; removed local `const` from `update()`; `sndFootstep`/`_tickAudio` can now read it

## 2026-04-05 — Session 160
- Phase 50 — Death sequence
  - `_deathTimer`: 2.5s countdown initiated on ghost catch instead of immediate `_endRound(true)`
  - `sndDeath()`: broadband static burst + high shriek + low subsonic thud; much louder/heavier than ghost scream
  - Death overlay: instant red flash → fast black-in (0.4s) → "ELIMINATED" + "the ghost got you" fade in
  - Controls frozen during death sequence (_deathTimer gate in movement block)
  - `_endRound(true)` fires when timer expires; results popup appears over corkboard as normal

## 2026-04-05 — Session 159
- Phase 49 — Ghost presence detection
  - `_roomAtPoint(ghostX, ghostY)` compared to `_roomAtPoint(player center)` each update frame
  - Edge detect: `_prevGhostInRoom` → fires once when ghost transitions into player's room
  - `sndColdWind()`: low noise + 48Hz rumble + staggered bass; plays on entry
  - `ghostPresenceFlash = 3.0`: "PRESENCE FELT" cyan-white overlay (3s, fade-in/out); subtler than evidence flashes
  - Gated on `safeTimeOver && !ghostHunting`

## 2026-04-05 — Session 158
- Guest button click handler wired (`_enterCorkboard()` on `b.id === "guest"`)
- Start investigation was blocked because no localStorage session → `menuPhase = "profile"` → login gate
- Guest button already rendered + registered in `_profBtnRects`; click handler was the missing piece

## 2026-04-05 — Session 157
- Phase 48 — Ghost status HUD badges (top-left, below evidence count)
  - "GHOST ATTRACTED" amber pulsing badge when ghostAttractTimer > 0 && !ghostHunting; warns player ghost is heading their way
  - Thaye age badge: shows "THAYE Xm (Y%)" where X = elapsed minutes, Y = current hunt threshold; color red <3m, amber 3-7m, green ≥7m (corresponds to tier drops)
  - Badges stack dynamically below smudge badge

## 2026-04-05 — Session 156
- Phase 47 — Ghost activity heat map on minimap
  - ghostActivityRooms: Map<room, cumulative_strength>; updated every time recordGhostActivity() fires
  - Drawn as 6b in minimap pipeline — red (#ff3010) hottest, orange (#e07020) warm, dark red (#a04010) cool
  - Alpha scales 0–32% based on normalized heat fraction; most active room is always fullest
  - Gives players a way to identify ghost's favourite room from the van without entering the house

## 2026-04-05 — Session 155
- Phase 46 — Ghost scare events
  - ghostScareTimer: initialized to 60–120s on round start; fires independently of evidence events
  - On scare: ghostAppearTimer = 0.4s (brief flash), ghostHuntFlash = 0.6s (red screen tint), -5% sanity, sndGhostScream()
  - sndGhostScream(): noise burst + descending sawtooth shriek with stagger
  - Gated on safeTimeOver, ghost not hunting, ghost within 200px
  - Resets to 60–180s after each scare

## 2026-04-05 — Session 154
- Phase 45 — Ghost Orb evidence polish
  - orbSeenFlash: 2s blue-purple overlay "GHOST ORB DETECTED" on first orb sighting per round
  - _orbSeenThisRound flag prevents repeated notifications; resets in startRound()
  - Detection uses _orbsInCameraView() — same cone geometry as existing render, ensures badge matches screen
  - Orb visual: outer pulsing halo (r=22, sin-animated), inner glow expanded to r=12, floor alpha 0.15→0.20
  - All 7 canonical evidence types now have detection notifications

## 2026-04-05 — Session 153
- Phase 44 — Evidence detection flash expansions
  - ghostWriteFlash: 2s purple overlay "GHOST WRITING DETECTED" when ghost writes in open book
  - uvMarkFlash: 2s violet overlay "UV FINGERPRINT DETECTED" when new UV mark deposited on door
  - freezingFlash: 2s cyan overlay "FREEZING TEMPERATURES DETECTED" on first thermometerReading ≤ 0°C
  - All 6 evidence types now have detection notifications (EMF5, DOTS, GhostWrite, UV, Freezing from Phase 40/44; SpiritBox has its own overlay)

## 2026-04-05 — Session 152
- Phase 43 — Per-ghost hue tint on passive appearances
  - getGhostHue(): 24-entry map of ghost names to hue-rotate degrees (Spirit 0°, Banshee 280°, Demon -20°, Yurei 160°, Oni -40°, etc.)
  - Applied as CSS filter on passive ghostAppearTimer renders (non-hunt, non-warning)
  - ctx.filter template: saturate(15%) sepia(0.5) hue-rotate({hue+180}deg) saturate(180%) brightness(0.85)
  - Hunt warning stays orange, active hunt stays red — only passive tint uses ghost hue

## 2026-04-05 — Session 151
- Phase 42 — Crucifix charges system
  - Crucifix now blocks hunt START (hunt roll passes → check crucifix → blocked with charge cost) instead of ending active hunt
  - 2 charges per Crucifix item (charges field initialized on first use); spent state when charges reach 0
  - Visual: cross dims to dark grey/brown when spent; 2 gold dot indicators below cross
  - sndCrucifix(): three-tone holy ringing (880, 1760, 1320 Hz sine waves with stagger)
  - "CRUCIFIX ACTIVATED" overlay: gold text + radial edge glow; 2.2s with fade-in/fade-out

## 2026-04-05 — Session 150
- Phase 41 — Oni + Myling specialRule implementations
  - no_mist_form (Oni): ghostAppearTimer bumped to max(8) on ghost events; ghost stays fully visible much longer
  - more_active_near_players (Oni): when player is < 120px away, effectiveRate = activityRate × 1.8 → event interval reduced from ~5.3s to ~2.9s average
  - high_parabolic_activity (Myling): each ghost event spawns an extra EMF source (L2–4) and extra ghostInteractMark at ghost position

## 2026-04-05 — Session 149
- Phase 40 — Evidence detection flashes + hunt pressure scaling
  - emfL5Flash: 2s overlay "EMF LEVEL 5 DETECTED" (red) on edge-detect of emfLevel reaching 5
  - dotsFlash: 2s overlay "D.O.T.S. FIGURE DETECTED" (purple) on edge-detect of dotsDisturbTimer going > 0
  - Both have 0.375s fade-in and 0.8s fade-out; appear below screen center (y+40..+56)
  - Hunt check interval: non-Demon ghosts now scale 4-6s (full sanity) → 1.5-2.5s (zero sanity) for pressure

## 2026-04-05 — Session 148
- Phase 39 — Ghost interaction audio + flash appearance
  - sndDoorCreak(): low sawtooth creak + noise burst; fires on regular ghost door open/close; ghost flashes 0.8s
  - sndLightClick(): sharp noise burst + square tick; fires when ghost flips light switch; ghost flashes 0.6s
  - Yurei door slam already had sndDoorSlam(); now also bumps ghostAppearTimer to 1.2s
  - Brief ghost flash makes interactions feel visceral without cheap jumpscares

## 2026-04-05 — Session 147
- Phase 38 — Proximity audio events
  - sndGhostBreath(): quiet hiss + soft tone; fires every 3.5–6.5s when ghost is within 90px and not hunting
  - sndWhisper(): mid-freq noise burst + airy tone; fires every 8–20s when playerSanity < 20%
  - sndGhostMoan(): low warble sawtooth; fires every 8–14s during active ghost hunt
  - New timers: _sndBreathTimer, _sndWhisperTimer, _sndMoanTimer; all reset in startRound()

## 2026-04-05 — Session 146
- Phase 37 — Incense system polish
  - smudge_extended_pacify: incensePacified now uses beh.incenseDuration (Spirit = 180s, others = 90s)
  - smudge_room_trap (Yurei): on incense activation, resets ghostRoamTimer, sets ghostHomeTimer = full pacify duration; canMigrate gated on !(smudge_room_trap && incensePacified > 0)
  - SMUDGED HUD badge: shown top-left below evidence badge while incensePacified > 0; countdown in seconds, pulsing alpha

## 2026-04-05 — Session 145
- Phase 36 — Evidence system polish
  - newEvidenceFlash state: {name, timer 2.5s} set when player clicks neutral→confirmed in journal
  - "NEW EVIDENCE CONFIRMED" + evidence name drawn center-screen with fade-in (0.375s) and fade-out (last 1s); dark strip background
  - Evidence count badge: "EVIDENCE X/3" drawn below sanity bar (top-left HUD), always shown after safe time; green at 3, amber at 1-2, dim at 0
  - Flash and badge reset properly in startRound()

## 2026-04-05 — Session 144
- Phase 35 — Ghost behavior visual events
  - Onryo candle extinguish flash: orange radial burst (r 8→30px, 0.45s) at candle position when ghost snuffs it out
  - Poltergeist throw arcs: small brown rectangle flies parabolic arc from ghost to EMF landing spot (0.35–0.55s duration); one arc per thrown item
  - Both state arrays reset in startRound(); animations tick in update() using delta

## 2026-04-05 — Session 143
- Phase 34 — Hunting improvements
  - Revenant LOS HUD: during active hunt, shows "IT SEES YOU" (red) when huntLostSightTimer==0, "SEARCHING" (blue) when ghost lost trail — only visible for Revenant (speed_jumps_on_los)
  - Yokai voice detection HUD: pulsing "YOKAI HEARS YOU" warning when Spirit Box is listening AND Yokai is within 200px AND not hunting; helps player understand voice-aggression mechanic

## 2026-04-05 — Session 142
- Phase 33 — Ghost event visual interactions
  - emfPulses[]: expanding ring visual (orange level 4, red level 5) spawned on EMF 4-5 events; radius expands 60px/s, alpha decays 2.5/s
  - ghostInteractMarks[]: dark brown elliptical smear marks left at ghost position on interactNearby action; max 12; visible without tools
  - Both arrays reset in startRound()

## 2026-04-05 — Session 141
- Phase 32 — Thermometer HUD + frost visual
  - Temperature badge: shown below sanity bar when temp < 15°C; color-coded (white/cold blue/cyan freezing); includes ❄ icon when freezing
  - Frost vignette: radial blue-white gradient at room edges when thermometerReading ≤ 0°C; intensity scales with depth below 0°C (max -6°C); animated sparkle dots from gameTime

## 2026-04-05 — Session 140
- Phase 31 — Footstep sounds
  - sndFootstep(surface): wood/tile/concrete/grass/van surface detection from room label; sprint vol 0.10 vs walk 0.06
  - sndGhostFootstep(): deeper creak+noise; fires at stride rate scaled by ghost huntSpeedLOS during hunt
  - Myling (silent_hunt_footsteps) skips ghost footsteps entirely
  - Player stride: 0.44s walk, 0.26s sprint; timer resets when player stops moving
  - All wired in _tickAudio(); timers reset in startRound()

## 2026-04-05 — Session 139
- Phase 30 — Ambient soundscape
  - sndCreak(): double-tone wood creak; fires every 6–16s in dark rooms (65% chance), 12–22s lit (30% chance)
  - sndDrip(): water drip; fires every 4–12s in rooms labeled Bath/Laundry/Kitchen (55% chance)
  - sndLowHeartbeat(): sub-bass dual pulse; fires when sanity < 30%, BPM scales with panic (40+sanity_deficit)
  - All gated on safeTimeOver && !ghostHunting (no ambience during hunts — silence is scarier)
  - Timers reset in startRound() with randomized offsets to stagger first occurrences

## 2026-04-05 — Session 138
- Phase 29 — Photo Camera evidence
  - pegQty 0 → 1 (Photo Camera now available on pegboard)
  - R key: detects Ghost/EMF Activity/Fingerprint/Salt Footprint/Ghost Writing/Freezing Temperature/D.O.T.S. Figure within 200px
  - Each type captured once per round; photosTaken[] stores evidence types
  - White screen flash (0.22s) with captured type label; sndPhotoShutter() click sound
  - _endRound(): +25 XP for ghost photo, +10 XP per unique evidence photo type
  - photoFlashTimer ticks in update loop; state reset in startRound()

## 2026-04-05 — Session 137
- Phase 28 — Spirit Box static + D.O.T.S. audio
  - sndSpiritBoxStatic(): short radio noise burst every 100–160ms while spiritBoxListenTimer > 0
  - sndSpiritBoxResponse(): three-tone frequency sweep on confirmed ghost response (spiritBoxTimer transition)
  - sndDotsPing(): dual-harmonic soft ping when dotsDisturbTimer transitions from 0 to > 0
  - All three wired in _tickAudio(delta) with transition flags (_sndPrevSBResp, _sndPrevDots)
  - Reset flags in startRound()

## 2026-04-05 — Session 136
- Phase 27 — Audio system
  - AudioContext created lazily on first keydown or click (browser autoplay policy)
  - _playTone(freq, dur, vol, type, attack, release) — oscillator helper
  - _playNoise(dur, vol, cutoffFreq) — white noise burst with lowpass filter
  - Named sounds: sndEMFTick (rising-pitch clicks per level), sndHuntWarning (low two-beat drone), sndHuntPulse (heartbeat thud every 0.78s), sndGhostEvent (crackle), sndDoorSlam (thud), sndSaltCrunch (brief crunch)
  - _tickAudio(delta): EMF tick timer scales with emfLevel; hunt warning fires once on transition; hunt pulse every 0.78s while ghostHunting; called at bottom of update()
  - Ghost event crackle wired to ghostEventTimer branch
  - Yurei door slam wired to closeDoor action execution
  - Salt crunch wired to ghost step detection
  - Audio state reset in startRound() (_sndPrevHunting, _sndPrevWarning, timers)

## 2026-04-05 — Session 135
- Phase 26 — Salt item
  - pegQty 0 → 2 (Salt now available on the pegboard)
  - World item visual: off-white elliptical granule mound; `it.stepped=true` shows darkened + drag scuff marks
  - HUD icon: flat salt pile in _drawHUDIcon switch
  - Ghost step detection: every frame after ghost moves, checks placed Salt within 18px; Wraith skips (no_footprints)
  - On step: `saltIt.stepped = true`, pushes 3 UV marks tagged `salt:true` into uvMarks[]
  - UV renderer split: fingerprints draw ridge arcs + palm smudge; salt footprints draw diffuse oval + 4 toe dots + heel blob

## 2026-04-05 — Session 134
- Phase 25 — Balance pass
  - Demon `frequent_hunts`: hunt check interval 1.5–2.5s (was 3–5s)
  - Power-off sanity multiplier: 1.6× → 1.35× (breaker starts OFF, early game was too punishing)
  - Shade no-hunt radius: 60px → 80px (more distinctly shy, player investigating from 70px no longer provokes)
  - Revenant `speed_jumps_on_los`: 0.4× speed when huntLostSightTimer>0 (lost trail), 2.1× when in LOS range
  - Mare `turns_off_lights`: 3× extra action weight on `touchLightSwitch` when the nearby switch is currently ON
  - Yurei `autonomously_closes_doors`: finds OPEN doors within 80px and adds `closeDoor` action (3× weight); executes by setting door.open=false

## 2026-04-05 — Session 133
- Phase 22 — Van minimap enhancements
  - EMF hotspot blips: placed active EMF Readers within 150px of level 4–5 source show pulsing dot (orange=4, red=5)
- Phase 23 — Round results XP
  - XP level-up loop: each level costs 30% more XP; leveledUp flag triggers "LEVEL UP!" badge
  - Results popup: level + LEVEL UP! badge, XP progress bar with fraction text
- Phase 24 — Hiding mechanic
  - hideTimer: counts up when player is still in a Closet/Walk-In room ≤120×120px
  - HIDING indicator at top-left (yellow → green at full hide)
  - Hiding reduces catch radius 18→10px; hunt LOS giveup time 5→3s when hideTimer > 3
  - Noise decays 3× faster while hiding (playerNoise extra drain)
  - hideTimer decays at 2×/s when moving or leaving the room

## 2026-04-05 — Session 132
- Phase 15 — Raiju: disrupts_electronics → turns off active items within 100px during hunt; occasional power cut
- Phase 16 — The Twins: dual_presence → decoy EMF fires in second room every 8–22s; ghostSpecialState.twinRoomA/B assigned at setup
- Phase 17 — The Mimic: copy_random_ghost → swaps form every 60–120s; getGhostBehavior now reads mimicTarget's behavior
- Phase 18 — Moroi: speed scales 1.0×→2.0× with sanity loss; spirit box adds −5% on top of base −3%
- Phase 19 — Hunt warning border: amber pulsing + "⚠ GHOST NEARBY ⚠"; hunt overlay now also shows remaining seconds
- Phase 20 — Ghost breaker event: non-Jinn ghosts near breaker have 6% action chance to cut power
- Misc: debug HUD shows Mimic current form + swap timer; null lines filtered from debug HUD array

## 2026-04-05 — Session 131
- Phase 7 — HUD + Ghost Special Rules
  - Sanity bar: top-left screen-fixed, 90×7px, color-coded (green/yellow/red), label below
  - Shade: no-hunt-when-group → won't hunt if player within 60px (shy near presence)
  - Onryo: flame_blocks_hunt → threshold=0 if active Incense/Firelight within 180px of ghost
  - Onryo: hunt_on_flame_extinguish → monitors flame count; 65% hunt trigger when last flame goes out, 1.5s warning
- Phase 8 — More Ghost Special Rules
  - Deogen: slows_near_target → fast (1.8×) at range, near-crawl (0.2×) within 30px, smooth lerp
  - Hantu: speed_from_cold → 2.0× speed at <5°C, 0.8× at >15°C via thermometerReading
  - Jinn: cant_turn_off_breaker → steers ghost away if within 60px of BREAKER_X/Y
- Phase 9 — Poltergeist + Banshee
  - Poltergeist: mass_throw_sanity_drain → 2–4 EMF spike scatter on roam, sanity drain (throwCount × 1.5%) if within 200px
  - Banshee: wail_on_roam → −4% sanity drain + brief red tint if player within 250px at roam start
- Phase 10 — Firelight Candle
  - pegQty raised 0→2 (now available on pegboard)
  - E-key interaction: lighter+lit→lights candle; E again→blows out
  - Ghost passes within 50px: 30% chance per second to extinguish candle
  - Active glow: warm flickering radial gradient when lit (uses gameTime for flicker)
  - Contextual E prompt: "light candle" / "blow out candle" / "need lit Lighter"
- Phase 11 — Sanity Meds
  - R key when Sanity Meds held: consume item, +35% sanity via setSanity()
  - HUD name suffix: " [R to use]" when selected
- Phase 12 — Yokai Aggression
  - Spirit Box response near Yokai: huntCooldown reduced by 8s
- Phase 13 — Atmosphere
  - Pre-event light flicker: subtle when ghostEventTimer < 1.5s (not during hunt)
  - Power-off drain multiplier: ×1.6 when breaker is off (darker = more terrifying)
- Phase 14 — Debug HUD
  - Added: playerNoise%, power state, ghostStuckTimer to debug readout line

## 2026-04-05 — Session 130
- Phase 4 — Evidence audit
  - EMF: held reader detects at 120px, placed active EMF Reader detects at 150px (player must be within 160px of placed reader to read it)
  - Ghost Orb camera-only enforcement confirmed already working — no changes needed
  - Freezing Temperatures thermometer system confirmed working — no changes needed
- Phase 5 — Player systems
  - Ouija break: 20% chance triggers a cursed hunt (no warning) when safeTimeOver; Demon immune (ouija_safe rule); hunt duration 25–35s
  - Sprint sanity drain: +0.8%/s extra loss when sprinting in a dark (unlit) room on top of passive dark drain
  - Held EMF Reader at level 4–5: makeNoise(0.4/s) — ghost can hear the device spiking
  - Held Spirit Box while active: makeNoise(0.35/s) — ghost hears chatter
- Phase 6 — Map/environment
  - Breaker starts OFF at round start — player must find the garage breaker to restore power
  - Room lights start randomized: ~40% on, ~60% off (felt off/ghost-influenced state)
  - Breaker flip: makeNoise(0.6) — loud clunk alerts ghost
  - Breaker prompt updated: color-coded ● POWER ON / ○ POWER OFF

## 2026-04-05 — Session 129
- Phase 1 — Core sanity plumbing
  - Added setSanity(v) helper (clamps 0–100); drainSanity() for discrete events unchanged
  - Routed all direct playerSanity mutations: startRound reset, passive drain (3 sites), voodoo pin, tarot fate/dawn/eclipse/saint/death
  - Added finalSanity snapshot to _resultsPopup object; displayed in results popup below ghost type label
  - Added gameRunning guard to passive drain block to prevent post-round ticks
- Phase 2 — Hunt + sanity events
  - Demon huntThreshold override → 100 (hunts at any sanity via quadratic curve)
  - Added _huntCooldownMult() → 0.55 for Demon, 1.0 others
  - Added _endHunt(cooldown) helper; replaced all 4 hunt-end sites (incense, crucifix, LOS loss, timeout)
  - Event drain hooks: spirit box response −3%, EMF5 near player −2%, ghost writing −3%, ouija question −5%, ouija break −10%; all exempt for Demon on ouija (ouija_safe rule)
  - Light flicker during huntWarning/ghostHunting: dual-frequency sin interference on powered lights
- Phase 3 — Ghost AI
  - Added ghostStuckTimer + playerNoise state variables; both reset in startRound()
  - Added makeNoise(amount) + ghostHearNoise() helpers (Yokai threshold 0.25 vs 0.55 standard)
  - Sprint footstep noise: 0.6/s sprinting, 0.15/s walking; decays 0.45/s; ghostHearNoise() called each frame
  - Door slam noise: makeNoise(0.7) when player opens a door
  - Stuck detection: ghostStuckTimer increments when fully blocked; after 2.5s teleports ghost to room center + recomputes path

## 2026-03-26 — Session 128
- Handheld camera viewfinder mode + NV toggle
- Removed PiP top-right box entirely
- holdingCamera = gameRunning && inventory[selectedSlot] === "Video Camera"
- When holdingCamera: normal room-visibility fog replaced with _applyCameraConeFog() on main fogCtx; player sees through 60° cone (same narrow FOV from camera system); flashlight glow overlay skipped
- N key toggles cameraNightVision (works when holding camera or in CCTV view)
  - NV on: green tint rgba(0,50,0,0.60) applied to world; fog fill #001400 (dark green); phosphor shimmer after fog
  - NV off: no tint; fog fill #050505 (near-black); same narrow cone shape
- _applyCameraConeFog(fCtx, W, H, zoom, camX, camY, facing, nightVision): extracted shared fog logic from renderCameraFeed; both handheld mode and CCTV renderCameraFeed now call this
- _drawViewfinderChrome(): corner brackets (green if NV on, grey if off), CAM/NV badge top-left, REC badge top-right when heldItemOn, NV/REC hint bottom-left, scanlines
- cameraNightVision reset on round start
- renderCameraFeed simplified: calls _applyCameraConeFog instead of repeating cone logic

## 2026-03-26 — Session 127
- Unified video camera system: shared renderCameraFeed core, handheld PiP, night vision, recording
- renderCameraFeed(tCtx, tFogCtx, W, H, zoom, camX, camY, facing): shared core function
  - Draws world (walls/rooms/doors/items-as-dots/player) from camera POV; no room-light overlays (NV sees dark)
  - Green tint pass before fog: rgba(0,50,0,0.60)
  - Fog: dark-green fill (#001400) + 60° cone punch clipped to camera's room; adjacent rooms through open doors
  - Vignette + fog stamp; phosphor shimmer overlay
- Handheld PiP: pipCanvas/pipFogCanvas 234×176 created once at init (PIP_ZOOM=1.2)
  - Shown in draw() after main fog stamp when Video Camera is selected slot
  - Position: top-right corner, x=canvas.width-244, y=10
  - renderCameraFeed() uses player pos + playerAngle as camera (live viewfinder)
  - _drawPiPChrome(): green border, HANDHELD CAM/NV badges, REC indicator (blinks when heldItemOn), scanlines
  - heldItemOn (R toggle) = handheld recording
- CCTV: drawCameraView() now calls renderCameraFeed(ctx, fogCtx, W, H, gameZoom, cam.x, cam.y, cam.facing)
  - cctvRecording state (R key in cameraViewMode toggles); REC dot only shown when cctvRecording
  - _drawCCTVChrome() updated: NV badge, conditional REC, R hint in bottom bar

## 2026-03-26 — Session 126
- CCTV camera viewing station in van
- State: cameraViewMode (bool), cameraViewIndex (int); reset on round start
- getPlacedCameras(): returns [{x,y,facing}] for all floor Video Cameras + Tripod.mountedCamera
- nearCCTV(): proximity check at x:305, y:904 — east side of van north wall
- Van draw: CCTV monitor box at x:283–323, y:893–910; active/inactive screen states; blink light; "CAM" label
- E key: enter cameraViewMode when nearCCTV(); ESC closes; ←/→ cycle cameras (consumes input, no game movement)
- drawCameraView(): full-canvas replace of normal draw when cameraViewMode is true
  - World drawn (walls, rooms, room-light overlays, doors, items as dots, player dot) centered on camera position
  - fogCanvas filled black, then narrow 60° cone punched (destination-out) clipped to camera's room
  - Adjacent rooms revealed through open doorways if doorway center falls within cone angle
  - Radial vignette (screen-space source-over) on fogCanvas for edge falloff
  - fogCanvas stamped to main ctx
  - _drawCCTVChrome() overlay: scanlines, top bar (CCTV FEED / CAM N/N), blink REC dot, bottom bar (ESC / cycle hint)
- No-signal screen: static stripes + "NO SIGNAL" text when no cameras placed
- Loop: when cameraViewMode, drawCameraView() replaces draw() + overlay stack; update() still runs (ghost moves)

## 2026-03-26 — Session 125 (revised)
- All three visual fixes for camera/furniture/tripod
- Root causes diagnosed:
  - Camera-on-furniture: furniture was drawn AFTER worldItems (line ~2087 vs ~1724), so furniture rendered ON TOP of camera body
  - Furniture occlusion: getVisibilityData() falls back to rooms[0] when player is outside; previous check saw curRoom=foyer and drew nightstand from outside
  - Tripod camera: -8px offset put camera at front leg tip (cy-7.5) not mount head (cy); looked detached
- Fix 1 (draw order): moved furniture block to BEFORE worldItems loop; camera on furniture now naturally layers on top of surface
- Fix 2 (furniture occlusion): replaced getVisibilityData() check with direct player-in-room test — find which rooms[] rect contains the furniture piece, then check player.x+8/y+8 is inside that room; no fallback
- Fix 3 (furniture placement): changed snap from furniture center to clamped probeX/probeY (inset 4px on sides, 2px top/bottom); camera can be placed anywhere across the surface
- Fix 4 (camera draw cleanup): removed the ctx.restore/re-push hack inside Video Camera draw block — no longer needed since draw order handles layering
- Fix 5 (tripod camera): reverted translate to (cx, cy) — the actual column mount center; added a two-tone bracket ring drawn before the camera body to visually show the physical mount connection

## 2026-03-26 — Session 124
- Camera placement fixes (3 fixes)
- Fix 1 (furniture snap): preview now snaps to center of matched furniture rect instead of floating at probe point; placed camera centered on surface
- Fix 2 (tripod mount): worldItems tripods without mountedCamera are now valid placement targets (18px radius); on commit, sets tripod.mountedCamera + tripod.cameraFacing instead of creating a new worldItem; camera drawn at tripod center with its own ctx.rotate(cameraFacing) at 0.75× scale
- Fix 3 (player angle lock): placementPreview stores lockedPlayerAngle at preview start; while preview.active, playerAngle is frozen to lockedPlayerAngle each frame; placementPreview.angle = raw mouse targetAngle (no lerp); player sprite doesn't rotate during placement
- Preview probe uses lockedPlayerAngle direction (fixed forward direction) not playerAngle

## 2026-03-26 — Session 123
- Camera furniture placement system added
- furniture[] const array: {x,y,w,h,label} entries; currently: Nightstand at foyer bottom-left (306,694,30×18)
- placementPreview state: {active, x, y, angle, valid} — updated each frame in update() while G held
- G keydown: Video Camera → sets placementPreview.active=true (no instant drop); all other items keep existing instant floor placement
- G keyup: if preview active + valid + Video Camera still held → commits worldItem at preview pos/angle; always clears preview
- preview.valid = any furniture rect contains the preview center point
- preview.angle tracks playerAngle live — rotate mouse to rotate camera before placing
- World draw: furniture rendered as warm-wood nightstand (shadow, top surface, drawer line+knob); camera ghost drawn at preview position with blue (valid) or red (invalid) fill+rim + dashed direction arrow
- HUD overlay: "release G to place camera / aim mouse to rotate" or "no surface — aim at furniture / release G to cancel"
- Tripod attachment (E key) unchanged and compatible — placed camera can still be picked up and mounted on tripod

## 2026-03-26 — Session 122
- Tripod basics implemented
- Tripod worldItem gets mountedCamera:null on placement (G key)
- E near tripod while holding Video Camera (selected slot) → attaches camera (removes from inventory, sets mountedCamera)
- E near tripod otherwise → pickup; if mountedCamera set, returns both Tripod + camera to inventory (checks 2 free slots)
- pegQty raised to 1 so Tripod appears in van equipment for testing
- Floor art: 1.5× scale (ctx.scale(1.5,1.5) inside the already-0.5× block); shadow ellipse, 3 legs, leg-tip circles, center column; camera block drawn on top when mountedCamera is set
- Held art: folded tripod column with crossed legs at bottom, head mount at top
- HUD pickup prompt: shows "mount camera on tripod" (blue), "pick up tripod + camera", or "pick up tripod" depending on state; blocked msg if inventory full
- Camera attachment is world-state only; inventory always stores separate strings

## 2026-03-26 — Session 121
- Spirit Box redesigned as player-triggered active tool (was passive periodic ghost event)
- R key starts a 2.5s listen window (spiritBoxListenTimer); hand art shows amber glow + pulsing tuner dial during window
- At window end, conditions evaluated: holding Spirit Box, ghost has evidence, within 180px, ghost in same room as player, room lights off; 85% chance in debug / 65% normal
- Removed Spirit Box from the periodic ghost event block entirely
- 3 distinct overlays with pill background: "listening" (amber pulsing dots during window), "no response" (grey dashes, 2s timeout), "response" (cyan ◈...◈ with fade, existing spiritBoxTimer)
- spiritBoxNoResponse cleared via setTimeout(2000) — brief flash then disappears
- spiritBoxListenTimer + spiritBoxNoResponse added to state vars and round-reset

## 2026-03-26 — Session 120
- Thermometer implemented
- roomTemps[]: one float (°C) per room index; initialized to 20 on round start
- Ghost cooling: each update frame, finds which room ghost is in by bounding box; lerps that room toward coldTarget (−10°C if Freezing Temperatures evidence, else 5°C); rate = 6°C/s in DEBUG_GHOST, 1°C/s normal
- Warmup: rooms not containing ghost drift back toward 20°C at 1°C/s
- Freezing threshold: 0°C (readout labels FREEZING below 0, COLD below 10)
- Thermometer readout: screen-center overlay when Thermometer is held item; shows temp with color (white=normal, blue=cold, cyan=freezing), label, and current room name
- Hand art updated: display color shifts to ice-blue when freezing; shows live rounded temp value
- No breath/fog evidence indicator as requested; evidence comes purely from reading the number

## 2026-03-26 — Session 119
- UV Light (Ultraviolet) evidence implemented
- uvMarks[] array added: persistent per-round array of {x,y} fingerprint locations
- Ghost event: on Ultraviolet evidence, finds nearest door within 80px of ghost, places mark at knob position; deduplicates by 12px radius; capped at 8 marks total
- markInUVCone(mx,my): checks held UV Flashlight (uvFlashlightOn + selected slot) and all active placed UV Flashlights; both use 180px range, PI/9 half-angle cone; returns true if mark is illuminated
- UV marks drawn in world after doors, before floor textures: radial purple glow + fingerprint ridge arcs + palm smudge ellipses; drawn only when markInUVCone returns true
- Placed UV Flashlight beam visual was already implemented; no changes needed there
- Held UV visual (fog partial-erase + hand art + enlarged panel) was already implemented
- uvMarks = [] added to round-reset block
- Debug ghost fires Ultraviolet every 2s; foyer doors are within 80px of ghost spawn → marks appear quickly

## 2026-03-26 — Session 118
- Ghost Writing implemented as location-based evidence
- Ghost Book has 3 visual states: closed cover (inactive), open blank with ruled lines (active, unwritten), open written with ink scrawls (written)
- Ghost event fires when: ev includes "Ghost Writing" AND an active unwritten book is within 120px of ghost
- Written state is permanent (persists as found evidence); writeAnimTimer=1.8 drives scribble shake+glow fade
- EMF event spawned at book location on writing (level 2-3, 10s duration) — writing counts as a ghost interaction
- Active indicator dot turns purple (bright during animation, dim after) when book is written
- Ghost Book drop now initializes written:false, writeAnimTimer:0 on the worldItem
- writeAnimTimer decays in the same ghost-evidence section as dotsDisturbTimer
- Ultimate Ghost (DEBUG_GHOST) fires Ghost Writing every 2s at 100% → place a book in the foyer to test

## 2026-03-26 — Session 117
- EMF Reader redesigned as location-based evidence (matches Phasmophobia behavior)
- Added emfSources[] array: each ghost interaction event pushes {x, y, level, timer} at ghost's position
- Removed global emfLevel/emfDecayTimer; emfLevel is now derived each frame from nearest source within 100px of player
- EMF only reads when EMF Reader is in the selected inventory slot (held); idle if holstered
- All ghosts generate EMF 2–4 on interactions; ghosts with "EMF Level 5" evidence get 30% chance of level 5
- Sources last 8–14s, capped at 6 (oldest removed if overflow); jitter ±10px so sources scatter slightly
- Display code (bar meter in hand + enlarged panel) unchanged — still reads emfLevel correctly
- Debug ghost fires EMF every 2s at 100%; walk into foyer with EMF Reader to see bars

## 2026-03-26 — Session 116
- Added getDotsProjectorAtGhost(): checks ghost (ghostX/Y) against actual cone geometry of each active D.O.T.S. projector (fwd 0–95px, lateral ±fwd×0.65+9); returns projector or null
- Removed old fixed-position stick figure from D.O.T.S. field draw — full ghost body replaces it
- Ghost visibility changed: ghost ONLY drawn when dotsDisturbTimer>0 AND getDotsProjectorAtGhost() returns a projector; unconditional DEBUG_GHOST draw removed
- D.O.T.S. ghost appearance: same body structure as normal ghost but all colors green-tinted; bright green eye glow; flickering green pulse dot on torso; scan-line shimmer overlay (1px lines every 3px)
- Fade: ctx.globalAlpha ramps from 0→1 over first 1.5s of disturb window, full after that
- Ghost keeps walking naturally while visible in D.O.T.S. form (movement code unchanged)
- Fog still handles wall/room occlusion — ghost in foyer hidden from outside by fog automatically
- Debug ghost: dotsDisturbTimer still fires every 2s at 100% in DEBUG_GHOST mode → ghost practically always visible once projector is placed in foyer

## 2026-03-26 — Session 115
- Added master ITEMS registry (const ITEMS[]) — single source of truth for all 28 items; replaces itemColors and directionalTools
- itemColors and directionalTools now derived from ITEMS via Object.fromEntries / Set filter — no game logic changed
- equipmentList now derived from ITEMS (spread map) — qty starts at pegQty, still mutable per session
- Added 15 stub items: Firelight, Head Gear, Motion Sensor, Parabolic Microphone, Photo Camera, Salt, Sound Sensor, Tripod + 7 cursed (Music Box, Ouija Board, Voodoo Doll, Haunted Mirror, Summoning Circle, Monkey Paw, Tarot Cards)
- All stubs have pegQty:0 — show as EMPTY on pegboard; can be enabled by setting pegQty > 0 in ITEMS
- pegboard virtualW now computed dynamically from item count; cols auto-scales as ITEMS grows
- shapes[i]() call wrapped with fallback — items without custom art show a grey ? card with category colour strip; no crash risk
- R key handler simplified: Flashlight/UV have dedicated paths; all other held items fall through to heldItemOn toggle (stub support)
- Phasmophobia name mapping noted in registry comments: Ghost Book=Ghost Writing Book, UV Flashlight=UV Light, Lighter=Igniter

## 2026-03-26 — Session 114
- Added canGhostMoveTo(nx, ny, confineRoom): mirrors canMoveTo — same door blocking, same walkable-rect containment
- confineRoom param restricts ghost to one specific room (inset 3px like walkable list); pass null for free roam later
- Ghost movement uses wall-sliding identical to player: try full move, then x-only, then y-only, then pick new target
- If fully blocked: 0.3s pause then new random target (prevents infinite stuck loop)
- Target picking: inset by GHOST_SIZE (16px) from room edges; falls back to room center if spot is invalid
- DEBUG_GHOST test ghost always passes ghostFavRoom as confineRoom — never leaves foyer
- Normal ghosts (DEBUG_GHOST=false) will pass null — free to roam when roaming is implemented

## 2026-03-26 — Session 113
- Ghost visibility: no change to fog system needed — ghost drawn in world space under fog canvas; walls/unlit rooms occlude it naturally
- Removed: mist aura circle, ghost name label — ghost is now a plain in-world entity
- Ghost movement: replaced instant-teleport drift with smooth waypoint walking (speed 1.4px/frame, ~47% of player)
- Waypoints: random positions inset 14px from room edges; pauses 0.6–2.2s at each; picks new target on arrival
- Ghost faces direction of travel (ghostMoveAngle = atan2 toward target); holds last angle when paused
- Walk animation: ghostWalkCycle accumulates while moving; same sin-based leg/arm swing as player
- New state vars: ghostTargetX/Y, ghostMoveAngle, ghostPauseTimer, ghostWalkCycle; all reset on startGame()

## 2026-03-26 — Session 112
- Ghost visible appearance: decayed player proportions — identical body structure to player sprite (same leg/arm/body/head coords)
- Dead pallor skin #adb89a (grey-green), bloodless grey hands, bare rotted feet, washed-out jacket
- Sunken eye sockets: large dark ellipses (2.0×1.5) replacing player's tiny 1.5px dot eyes; faint grey iris glow inside
- Sunken cheek shadows, forehead wound/gash, rot stain on torso
- Ghost always rotates to face the player (ghostFaceAngle = atan2 toward pcx,pcy)
- Faint cold mist aura (barely visible pulse, rgba 160,220,200)
- Debug ghost name label drawn dimly above head (only in DEBUG_GHOST mode)
- Structure is ready to extend: different ghosts can get small tweaks on top of this base

## 2026-03-26 — Session 111
- Added DEBUG_GHOST flag (top of file, alongside DEBUG_COLLISION)
- ultimateGhost object: all 7 evidence types, spawns in Foyer, never roams
- pickGhost() routes to ultimateGhost when DEBUG_GHOST=true; pins ghostFavRoom to rooms.find("Foyer")
- Evidence fires every 2s at 100% success in debug mode (vs 7–16s at 70%/25% normally)
- Safe-time check bypassed for debug ghost — evidence triggers immediately on round start
- Ghost rendered as pulsing blue stick figure with "GHOST" label; drawn in world-transform space
- To disable: set DEBUG_GHOST=false — all normal ghost behavior restores automatically

## 2026-03-25 — Session 110
- Flashlight fog cone now only clears fog when Flashlight is the selected slot (flashlightHeld check added to drawFlashlightInRoom)
- UV Flashlight split from regular flashlight: separate uvFlashlightOn bool; R key toggles it independently
- UV fog helper drawUVFlashlightInRoom: range 180 (vs 300), partial erasure (fillStyle rgba 0,0,0,0.55) — dimmer reveal
- UV flashlight dropped → uvFlashlightOn reset to false; display/label both updated to use uvFlashlightOn
- Lighter visibility: when lighter selected + lit, radial gradient fog clear r=65 (soft center fade) in destination-out block
- No candle item exists yet — lighter is the only warm-light source

## 2026-03-25 — Session 109
- D.O.T.S. grid refinement: rows 0–6, 15px spacing, 9px col spread, 1.0px dot radius — denser, sharper field (49 dots vs 24)
- Ghost figure preserved in field; works identically (dotsDisturbTimer check unchanged)
- Flashlight placed: gradient cone (0.38→0) + arc close path + lens glow dot; more visible and realistic
- UV Flashlight placed: purple gradient cone (mirrors flashlight)
- Sound Recorder placed: two staggered pulse rings (700ms offset) + steady red REC dot above
- Video Camera placed: blue FOV fan + blinking red REC dot (600ms on/off blink)
- Incense placed: warm orange radial glow around burning tips (r=28) — makes it feel lit
- Lighter held: small orange radial glow (r=55) in world space when lighter selected + lit; weaker than flashlight

## 2026-03-25 — Session 108
- Fixed Q key cycling: lighter now reachable as virtual 4th slot (selectedSlot === inventory.length when hasLighter)
- Lighter HUD slot highlights with white border + dark bg when selected; label shows "Lighter [LIT]" when lit
- Fixed placed tool active state: worldItems.push now uses `active: heldItemOn` instead of `active: false`
- Items turned on before placing (e.g. active D.O.T.S., recording Sound Recorder) stay active on the floor

## 2026-03-25 — Session 107
- Ghost now has a position (ghostX,ghostY) and favorite room (ghostFavRoom) set in pickGhost()
- Favorite room picked from interior rooms (w≥80, h≥80, w<400, h<400) — excludes outside and connectors
- Ghost drifts within favorite room slowly (12% chance per second to reposition)
- Periodic interaction check every 7–16s: 70% success rate in favorite room, 25% outside it
- Evidence: only fires if ghost's evidence[] includes that type
- EMF Level 5: raises emfLevel=5 on event; decays 1 level per 1.5s; EMF Reader (held+display) shows 5-bar rising meter, all red at level 5
- D.O.T.S. Projector: fires if active placed projector within 150px of ghost; draws green stick-figure outline in dot field for 5s with 2s fade; only on the projector nearest to ghost
- Spirit Box: fires only if player holds active Spirit Box (heldItemOn) within 180px of ghost; shows "◈ . . . ◈" screen-center overlay for 3.5s
- All 3 evidence types check ghost.evidence[] — wrong ghosts cannot fake evidence
- New state vars: ghostX,ghostY,ghostFavRoom,ghostEventTimer,emfLevel,emfDecayTimer,dotsDisturbTimer,spiritBoxTimer

## 2026-03-25 — Session 106
- Removed panel box/frame from enlarged held-item display; item art now floats at fixed screen position (center ~744,510)
- Item name label kept with drop-shadow text instead of box border
- Added heldItemOn (bool) and heldItemUsing (bool) state vars; reset in showGame(), on Q (slot switch), on G (drop)
- R key handler expanded: Flashlight/UV toggle flashlightOn; Sound Recorder/D.O.T.S./Video Camera/Incense/EMF/Spirit Box/Thermometer toggle heldItemOn; Lighter only when no held item
- Hold-to-use: in update(), R held while Sound Recorder is on sets heldItemUsing=true (recording mode)
- Sound Recorder now has 3 visual states: off (dark), on/idle (green mic + dim red REC), recording (red body tint + bright green mic + bright red REC) — in both hand and enlarged display
- D.O.T.S. Projector, Video Camera, Incense now respond to R key via heldItemOn

## 2026-03-25 — Session 105
- Floor items: ctx.scale 0.75→0.5 (half player size)
- In-world hand item: ctx.scale 1.6→0.65, translate 10,-6→7,-3 (half player size, close to hand)
- Lighter in-hand: same scale/translate change
- Added screen-fixed enlarged held-item display: panel at (698,462) 92×92px, item drawn at 3.5× scale
- Display shows all 13 inventory items + lighter with full state-based art (flashlightOn for torches, lighterLit for lighter, TODO placeholders for others)
- Display hidden when nothing held; item name label above panel
- Panel uses same dark/amber palette as existing HUD

## 2026-03-25 — Session 104
- Held item scaled up: translate(7,-4) → translate(10,-6), added ctx.scale(1.6,1.6) — items ~60% larger in hand
- Lighter also scaled up to match
- Flashlight: off=dark lens, on=bright yellow lens + two-layer glow halo
- UV Flashlight: off=dim purple lens, on=bright violet lens + purple glow
- Lighter: unlit=body only, lit=orange flame body + yellow tip + warm glow halo (all more prominent)
- Video Camera, Sound Recorder, D.O.T.S., Incense: `const xOn = false; // TODO` placeholder for future held-state wiring
- Crucifix and Sanity Meds: detailed single-state visuals; comments note no game state yet
- Ghost Book: open two-page ruled visual
- Thermometer: probe shaft + teal display with °C label
- EMF Reader: all 4 LEDs always lit (no held off-state yet)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 103
- Placed items scaled to 0.75× with ctx.scale inside their draw block (feels smaller than player)
- Player: arms added (left swings, right stiffens when holding), shoes added, ears added, hair arc added, leg swing amplitude increased to 4, shadow enlarged
- Held item: replaced colored stub with per-item mini art at right-hand position (translate(7,-4)) — 10 items have custom mini visuals (Flashlight, UV Flashlight, Video Camera, EMF Reader, Spirit Box, Sound Recorder, D.O.T.S. Projector, Thermometer, Ghost Book, Lighter); others fallback to colored stub
- Right arm no longer swings when holding an item (rightSwing=0 when holdingItem)
- walkCycle bodyBob removed (arms provide the sense of motion instead)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 102
- Replaced 12×12 colored-square world item art with per-item top-down detailed visuals
- Each item drawn with ctx.save/translate(cx,cy)/rotate(f)/restore so facing is automatic
- Items with detailed art: Flashlight, UV Flashlight, Video Camera, D.O.T.S. Projector, Sound Recorder, EMF Reader, Spirit Box, Thermometer, Ghost Book, Lighter, Incense, Crucifix, Sanity Meds
- All on/off states visually distinct (lens glow, LED color, REC dot, flame, ember tips, ghost writing)
- Facing arrow removed (orientation now shown by the art itself)
- Active indicator dot kept as small screen-aligned dot at item origin (top-right)
- Label moved up to cy-14 to clear larger item silhouettes

## 2026-03-25 — Session 101
- Fixed broken pegboard: adding D.O.T.S. Projector in Session 100 pushed equipmentList to 13 items but shapes[] only had 12 entries
- shapes[12]() was undefined → TypeError → ctx.restore() never called → canvas save stack leaked every frame, corrupting all rendering
- Fix: inserted D.O.T.S. Projector shape at index 8 in shapes[] (after Sound Recorder)
- Fix: switched from 4-per-row to 5-per-row layout so 13 items fit in 3 rows without needing rowEy[3]
- Updated virtualW from 1260 → 1060 (5 cols × 200 + 60)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 100
- worldItems now store {name, x, y, facing, active} — facing = playerAngle at drop time
- Added lighterLit bool; lighter shows bright yellow flame glow when lit
- Added keybinds.use = "r"; R toggles nearest placed item OR held flashlight/lighter
- Per-item placed visuals: Flashlight beam cone, D.O.T.S. dot grid, Sound Recorder pulse ring, Video Camera red dot, direction arrow for directional tools, green/dark active indicator dot
- D.O.T.S. Projector added to equipmentList (qty:2) and itemColors (#40c070)
- Sound Recorder qty updated from 0 → 2
- directionalTools Set added for tools that show facing arrow when placed
- "Use / Toggle" keybind added to Options tab (keybinds.use, default R)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 99
- Fixed keybind rebinding bug: `rw` was missing from the click handler's journal constants block
- `rx + rw - 14` evaluated to NaN → keybind row hit-test always failed silently
- Fix: added `const rw = 350;` to the click handler journal section (matching drawJournal)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 98
- Options tab: removed "Movement Speed" setting; movement speed is no longer player-adjustable
- Sensitivity repurposed as "Flashlight Sensitivity" — lerp rate for playerAngle tracking cursor
  - Low (0.5×) = sluggish atmospheric tracking; High (2.0×) = near-instant snap; Default 1.0×
- Added sprint: hold Sprint key (default: Shift) to move at 1.6× speed
- Sprint added to keybinds object and keybind table in Options tab
- keydown/keyup listeners now also store e.key.toLowerCase() so modifier keys (Shift → "shift") work with keybinds system

## 2026-03-25 — Session 97
- Added Options journal tab (tab index 2): Settings on left page, Key Bindings on right page
- Added state vars: sensitivity (float 0.5–2.0), keybinds (object), rebindingAction (null or action string)
- Sensitivity controls: [-] [value] [+] buttons + visual bar; affects movement speed via multiplier
- Keybind rebinding: click a row on right page → row highlights gold + shows "press any key..." → next keypress sets binding
- ESC cancels rebind without changing the key; rebindingAction reset on showGame()
- All 9 actions rebindable: up/down/left/right/interact/flashlight/journal/drop/inventory
- Movement code now uses keybinds[action] + arrow key fallback; interaction keys use keybinds too
- Tab labels updated: 3 tabs at spacing 130px, width 118px; "Evidence & Suspects" shortened to "Evidence"

## 2026-03-25 — Session 96
- Journal redesigned as open two-page book spread (760px wide, 496px tall)
- Left leather spine at x=20, center crease at x=402 with shadow gradient, dark gap
- Both pages drawn by shared drawPage() helper (aged paper, ruled lines, border)
- Tab 0: Evidence on left page (7 rows, 30px spacing), Suspects list on right page (2 cols of 12)
- Tab 1: Ghost list all 24 on left page (1 col, 18px rows), Selected ghost details on right page
- Ghost detail right page shows: name, 3 evidence pills, notes (word-wrapped), behaviour hint
- Right page title = selected ghost name when on Ghost Guide tab
- All click coordinates updated to match new lx/rx layout
- Tabs repositioned above left page as "Evidence & Suspects" and "Ghost Guide"

## 2026-03-25 — Session 95
- Evidence: single click on row cycles neutral → confirmed (green ✓) → crossed (red ✕) → neutral
- Ghost list: single click on row cycles neutral → selected ★ → crossed (strikethrough) → neutral
- Selecting a neutral ghost makes it the guess; the previous guess goes neutral automatically
- Crossing out the current guess sends playerGuess back to "Spirit"
- Removed separate ✕ button from ghost rows — full row is the click target now
- Evidence hit area widened to 200px (covers label), no separate second box

## 2026-03-25 — Session 94
- Journal redesigned for single-click / tap interaction (no right-click split)
- mousedown listener reverted to click; contextmenu suppressor removed
- Evidence rows: left ✓ box = toggle confirmed, separate right ✕ box = toggle crossed out

- Evidence hint updated: "✓ = have it   ✕ = ruled out"
- Ghost hint updated: "Click name = set guess  ·  ✕ button = cross out"

## 2026-03-25 — Session 93
- Ghost list now supports 3 states: selected guess (★), crossed out (✕ + strikethrough), neutral
- Added ghostStates{} object (ghost name → "crossed"); reset in showGame()
- Left click = set as active guess (also un-crosses the ghost if it was crossed)
- Right click = toggle crossed out
- canvas "click" listener changed to "mousedown" to capture right-click (button===2)
- contextmenu event suppressed on canvas to prevent browser right-click menu
- Ghost row visuals: gold bar + gold text (guess), red bar + red text + strikethrough (crossed)
- Bottom hint updated: "Left click = set guess · Right click = cross out"

## 2026-03-25 — Session 92
- Evidence states upgraded: checkedEvidence (Set) replaced with evidenceStates (object: ev → "confirmed"|"crossed")
- Click cycles: neutral → confirmed → crossed → neutral
- Narrowing logic: confirmed must be in ghost's evidence[], crossed must NOT be in evidence[]
- playerGuess now defaults to "Spirit" on round start (no longer null)
- Ghost tab: clicking a ghost always sets it as the guess (no deselect); exactly one guess at all times
- HUD and keypad text updated to always show current guess

- Added nearKeypad() helper (van north wall ~x:210, y:900); E opens keypadOpen
- Van keypad device drawn in van interior: small dark box with status LED (red/green) + "KPD" label
- drawKeypad(): dark panel at canvas center; shows current guess + action button; "Open Van Doors" (green) when vanDoor closed, "Leave Site" (red) when open; ✕ close button top-right
- "Leave Site" click: ends round, sets roundOver=true, evaluates guess vs currentGhost
- Removed old exit-zone trigger (was the only round-end path)
- drawResult() rewritten: shows player's guess, actual ghost name, outcome headline; handles no-guess case cleanly
- game loop: keypadOpen blocks update(); drawKeypad() called after draw()
- ESC handler: keypadOpen closes first; removed guessing from ESC path

## 2026-03-25 — Session 89
- Real ghost system: currentGhost is the one hidden identity for the run, chosen by pickGhost() from the 24-ghost roster
- Removed ghost.visible = true from update loop — ghost position still tracked internally, never rendered
- Removed the semi-transparent roaming ghost rect from draw()
- ghostFlash, ghost position/speed kept for future use (hunt system etc.)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 88
- Replaced ghost roster with full 24-ghost list (Spirit through Thaye)
- Evidence types updated to exact canonical names: EMF Level 5, Spirit Box, Freezing Temperatures, Ultraviolet, Ghost Writing, Ghost Orb, D.O.T.S. Projector
- Each ghost has exactly 3 evidence types matching the official list

- All logic/data identical — visual only

## 2026-03-25 — Session 84
- World item drop/place/pickup system added
- worldItems[] array: {name, x, y}; cleared on showGame()
- G key: places selected inventory item 22px in front of player (based on playerAngle); removes from inventory; flashlight turns off if dropped
- E key: extended to pick up nearby world items first (radius 30); respects 3-item limit and lighter exception; blocked silently if full
- World items drawn as 12×12 colored squares with short name label above
- "E — pick up" prompt shows when near a world item; grayed out + message if blocked
- "G — place/drop selected" hint shown in HUD when holding an item

## 2026-03-25 — Session 83
- Inventory/pickup system implemented
- "Flashlight" added to equipmentList (qty:2, index 0) with torch silhouette shape
- Player starts with no flashlight; F key gated on inventory.includes("Flashlight")
- Pickup: click slot on pegboard — lighter→hasLighter (free slot), others→inventory[] (max 3, no dupes)
- Q key cycles selectedSlot through inventory
- Inventory HUD: 3 slots + lighter slot at bottom-left; selected slot highlighted gold
- Held-item visual: colored stub drawn on player in rotated local space (forward = -y)

- Clue lines moved up to y:530/544 to clear inventory HUD space

## 2026-03-25 — Session 82
- Removed pegZoom and all pegboard zoom code; pegboard hint simplified back to scroll-only
- Added gameZoom variable (default 1.8, range 0.8–3.0); const ZOOM = gameZoom in draw()
- +/= or numpad+ zooms in gameplay; -/_ or numpad- zooms out; gated to gameRunning only
- Zoom% shown in HUD top-right below mode label

## 2026-03-25 — Session 81
- Fixed pegboard zoom: replaced e.key ("+"/"=") with e.code ("Equal"/"Minus"/"NumpadAdd"/"NumpadSubtract")
- Replaced translate/scale/translate chain with single ctx.setTransform() call — atomic and unambiguous
- toFixed(1) on pegZoom to avoid floating point drift (0.6000000001 etc)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 80
- Added pegZoom variable (default 1.0, range 0.6–2.0); resets on pegboard open
- +/= zooms in, -/_ zooms out; board translate now: translate(bx,by) → scale(pegZoom) → translate(-pegScrollX,0)
- maxScroll computed live: max(0, virtualW - bw/pegZoom)
- Scroll indicator thumb width and position adjust with zoom
- Hint updated to show current zoom %

## 2026-03-25 — Session 79

- New items: Sound Recorder (qty:0 = empty slot demo), Sanity Meds, Lighter, Incense, Crucifix
- qty=0 slot: dark card (#0e0c08), EMPTY label, dim name/desc
- qty>0 slot: colored card + silhouette + green ×N badge top-right
- Board widened to 3900px virtual, 16 placeholder slots, max scroll 2000px
- New silhouettes drawn for all 5 new items

## 2026-03-25 — Session 77

- Added 10 dotted-outline placeholder slots across 2430px virtual board (only 6 filled)
- Max scroll bumped to 800px to show empty expansion space
- Labels re-centered on 180px card (ex+90)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 76
- Fixed rain on road: rain block was drawn before road fillRect which painted over it; moved rain to after road+tape, before van body
- Rain opacity bumped 0.30→0.35 for road visibility
- Sunrise/sunset outside gradient peak raised 0.22→0.36, mid 0.09→0.15

## 2026-03-25 — Session 75
- Rain clip rect now branches on playerOutside: outside → rect(60,60,700,922) covers roof+yard+road; inside → rect(60,720,700,262) keeps interiors dry

## 2026-03-25 — Session 74
- Rain clipped to outside rect (ctx.clip) — no rain inside house or van
- Removed post-fog screen-space blood moon / nightrain tints — they were bleeding interior rooms
- Blood moon + nightrain env.tint alphas raised to compensate (0.35→0.55, 0.30→0.50, 0.20→0.32)
- Sunrise/sunset outside gradient peak raised 0.10→0.22 so exterior wash is clearly visible

## 2026-03-25 — Session 73
- Replaced flat foyer/van sunlight fills with clipped radial gradients centered at each opening
- Foyer: gated on front door open; gradient from door threshold (400,720) radius 90px, clipped to foyer rect
- Van: gated on vanDoor.open; gradient from east opening (360,926) radius 80px, clipped to van interior
- Closed door now = zero light leak in all cases

## 2026-03-25 — Session 72
- Refined sunrise/sunset directional sunlight: outside peak reduced 0.16→0.10, foyer now gated on front door open (rgba 0.04 flat instead of gradient), van stays always-on at 0.04
- Foyer leak removed when front door closed — walls now believably block sunlight
- No changes to movement, camera, collision, van, fog, or roof

## 2026-03-25 — Session 71
- Fixed van/movement crash: `const mode` was declared in screen-space section but used in world-space block above it — ReferenceError stopped draw() mid-execution
- Fix: moved `const mode = envModes[envModeIdx]` to top of draw(), changed `const env = ENV[envModes[envModeIdx]]` to `ENV[mode]`, removed duplicate declaration

## 2026-03-25 — Session 70
- Removed skyGlow full-world tint from ENV (was the main "light passes through walls" culprit)
- Removed sunrise/sunset screen-space gradients entirely
- Added world-space directional sunlight clipped to: outside rect (0.16 peak), foyer (0.07 peak), van interior (0.05 flat)
- Fog naturally blocks the world-space tint from reaching deeper rooms
- ENV simplified: sunrise/sunset have no tint; only blood moon/rain keep the old tint system
- Foyer gets slight warmth leak; hallway and beyond get nothing

## 2026-03-25 — Session 69
- Removed M key — player can no longer manually switch modes
- envModeIdx now set randomly on Start button click
- Sunrise/sunset gradient alphas cut roughly in half (~0.65→0.30 peak, bloom 0.45→0.20)
- Blood moon radial alpha reduced (0.55→0.28 peak)
- Night rain tint reduced (0.22→0.15)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 68
- Sunrise: directional LinearGradient right→left (bright orange east, shadow west) + radial bloom at right horizon
- Sunset: directional LinearGradient left→right (bright red-orange west, shadow east) + radial bloom at left horizon
- Blood moon: radial gradient from top-center (eerie red glow overhead, dark at edges)
- Night rain: flat blue-gray tint; blood moon rain: blood moon + extra dark haze
- Removed screenTint property from ENV — lighting handled directly per mode in draw()
- Sunrise/sunset fog opacity lowered slightly (0.80/0.83) so warm ambient color bleeds through more

## 2026-03-25 — Session 67
- Fixed env mode visual bug: tints were applied in world space BEFORE fog, so fog covered them — moved to screen-space screenTint drawn AFTER fog stamp so it tints all visible content
- Mode label fixed: was nearly invisible (#4a4040 dark gray); now warm-white #d0c8b0 with shadow, clean switch statement for label strings
- Each mode now clearly distinct: sunrise=orange, sunset=red-orange, bloodmoon=crimson, nightrain=blue, night=none

## 2026-03-25 — Session 66
- ENV reworked: fogColor (colored tinted fog per mode), skyGlow (full-world ambient tint), stronger outsideAlpha + tint values
- Sunrise: warm orange glow/tint, fog barely opaque (0.82), outside not darkened at all
- Sunset: deep red-orange, slightly more fog
- Blood moon: crimson sky glow + tint, full dark fog with red cast
- Night: pure cold dark, no glow
- Rain modes: visible blue-gray ambient cast
- Roof-reveal circle replaced: soft radial gradient (clear center → fade at 200 world units), matching sight range style

## 2026-03-25 — Session 65
- Added ZOOM = 1.8 constant; world transform now: translate to screen center → scale(ZOOM) → translate to player
- Fog canvas uses identical zoom transform
- Sight gradient radii scaled by ZOOM (90→162, 260→468 screen px) so sight range feels same in world units
- Flashlight glow radius scaled by ZOOM
- Mouse facing simplified: player always at canvas center, so atan2(mouseY - h/2, mouseX - w/2)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 64
- 6 environment modes: night, nightrain, sunrise, sunset, bloodmoon, bloodmoonrain
- M key cycles modes; current mode shown top-right HUD
- Each mode changes: bg sky color, outside dark overlay alpha, fog fill alpha, color tint (outside+roof), rain toggle
- Rain: 120 scrolling line particles, drift right+down, wrap around player, only drawn in rain modes
- Fog alpha lowered in sunrise (0.90) and sunset (0.92) so more ambient light leaks through everywhere
- Outside circle fog-clear: when playerOutside + front door CLOSED, punch 160px circle in fog extending into roof area; when door OPEN, skip (interior wedge handles visibility instead)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 63
- Roof fully redrawn: south+east exterior wall faces with brick rows + eave shadow for 3D depth
- 4 roof sections (west wing, east wing, garage, foyer) with distinct tones + south-slope ambient tint

- Roof valleys (dark creases where sections meet), fascia/eave boards on all 4 edges + gutters
- Chimney: brick body + mortar grid + cap slab + drop shadow

## 2026-03-25 — Session 62
- Outside night: dark overlay (rgba 0.52) over full yard+road area; removes broad daytime look
- Front-door exterior light: small warm radial gradient glow at walkway side of front door (x:400, y:726)
- Roof: drawn over house footprint (x:80–740, y:80–720) only when playerOutside (player.y+8 > 720)
- Roof has wing color variation, hallway ridge line, edge highlights/shadows, chimney detail
- When player goes inside, roof disappears — interior fully readable again

## 2026-03-25 — Session 61
- Van redesigned top-down: drop shadow, roof cutaway showing floor, north highlight, south shadow, cab bulkhead, side portholes, monitor shelf with blue-glow screens, 4 wheel top-down ovals
- Pegboard moved to south interior wall (long side); equipment stubs hang from peg holes
- nearPegboard() updated to south wall position (y:950)
- Equipment screen silhouettes redrawn: EMF wand+LEDs, Spirit Box radio+grill, UV torch+bloom, open Ghost Book+writing, Video Camera+lens, Thermometer+bulb+scale

## 2026-03-25 — Session 60
- Added van equipment wall: pegboard visual on west interior wall, nearPegboard() proximity check
- E key near pegboard opens equipmentOpen overlay; Escape closes it; update() pauses while open
- drawEquipment(): dark panel, peg-hole grid, 6 items each with silhouette, name, short desc
- Equipment list: EMF Reader, Spirit Box, UV Flashlight, Ghost Book, Video Camera, Thermometer
- View-only — no pickup or inventory logic yet

## 2026-03-25 — Session 59
- Replaced cube player with top-down person sprite: head (ellipse), body (jacket rect), legs (two rects)
- Walk animation: legSwing (sin-based offset, legs alternate) + bodyBob only while isMoving
- walkCycle increments each frame while moving; isMoving flag set after movement check
- Player still rotates with playerAngle; eyes on head mark facing direction

## 2026-03-25 — Session 58
- Player sprite now rotates to face mouse: body drawn with ctx.save/translate/rotate using playerAngle
- Front face visible as a bright highlight strip + dark nose dot on top edge of rotated rect
- Shadow offset rect gives subtle depth; gameplay readability preserved

## 2026-03-25 — Session 57
- Fixed gray-screen bug: mouse-facing code in update() referenced camX/camY which are only defined in draw()
- Fix: compute local _camX/_camY inline in update() using same formula as draw()

## 2026-03-25 — Session 56
- 360-degree mouse aiming: mousemove listener on canvas stores mouseX/mouseY in screen coords
- playerAngle now computed each frame via atan2(mouse - playerScreenPos); movement no longer affects angle
- Flashlight cone and visibility wedges automatically follow the new angle (no other changes needed)

## 2026-03-25 — Session 55
- Added roomLights array (one per interior room); switch at top-right corner of each room
- E key near switch toggles light on/off; green/gray indicator drawn at switch position

- Flashlight: 40° arc (±20°), 220px range, drawn as pie slice clipped to current + adjacent rooms
- Doorway wedges skipped for unlit adjacent rooms; flashlight still shines through them

## 2026-03-25 — Session 54
- Added sight range: radial gradient drawn on fogCanvas after destination-out pass
- Inner radius 90px fully clear, soft fade starts at 0.6, outer radius 260px near-opaque
- Player screen position computed from world coords minus camX/camY for accurate centering

## 2026-03-25 — Session 53
- Replaced even-odd rect visibility with doorway-wedge FOV system
- Added offscreen fogCanvas; darkness drawn there, destination-out punches holes for visible areas
- getVisibilityData(): finds current room + builds wedge {room, e1, e2} for each open doorway
- Wedges: triangle from player position through doorway edge points, extended 2000px, clipped to adjacent room
- Closed doors block sight completely; open doors show only the cone through the opening

## 2026-03-25 — Session 52
- Added visibility system: rectsOverlap + getVisibleRects helpers
- Darkness overlay uses canvas even-odd fill — outer rect = dark, visible room rects = punched holes
- Player sees current room + any room reachable through an open doorway
- Closed doors block sight; open doorway connectors included so gaps stay visible

## 2026-03-25 — Session 51
- Player now spawns inside the van (x:240, y:918); same on reset
- Added vanDoor object (starts closed); east wall blocked until opened
- Van rear opens like a trailer: closed = solid dark panel; open = ramp lying flat east with slat lines

- Fixed road walkability: Road Left/Right both h:100; Road South x:180,y:960,w:180,h:22 below van only
- Van Interior h:78→72 so it ends at y:960, no overlap with Road South
- Fixed connector y values: Road Left/Right ↔ Road South now at y:947 (correctly bridges both walkable areas)
- Yellow tape left/right extended to y:986; bottom at y:982

- 14 rooms: Hallway, Foyer, Master Bed, Master Bath, Walk-in (dead-end), Living Room, Dining Room, Kitchen, Utility, Garage, Bedroom 2, Main Bath, Study, Coat Closet
- 16 doorway connectors covering all room transitions
- Master chain: Master Bed → Master Bath → Walk-in only (no shortcuts)
- Garage accessed only via Utility → Garage (not from foyer)
- Study accessed only via Bedroom 2 (dead-end branch)
- Multiple routing loops: Foyer→Hallway→Living or Foyer→Main Bath→Living, LR→Dining or LR→Kitchen
- Updated evidence spawns, exit position, ghost bounds, player/ghost start positions
- Outer walls simplified to 4 segments; interior wall gaps from room spacing

## 2026-03-24 — Session 1
- Set up project planning files
- Defined game concept: top-down pixel horror, Phasmophobia-inspired
- Decided: browser-first, vanilla JS, single-player MVP
- Next: build canvas scaffolding and get a player moving

## 2026-03-24 — Session 2
- Built canvas scaffold: game loop, player rect, WASD/arrow movement, room boundary
- Added title screen with Start button; canvas hidden until clicked
- Next: ghost entity or multi-room tilemap

## 2026-03-24 — Session 3
- Replaced 1px border room with solid wall rects (20px thick, color #2a2a2a)
- Floor is now a separate inner rect; collision clamps to floor, not room outer edge
- Next: ghost entity (hidden, roaming inside the floor)

## 2026-03-24 — Session 4
- Added gameRunning flag to control loop and screen state
- ESC key returns to title screen and resets player to (380, 280)
- showTitle() / showGame() functions handle screen switching
- "ESC — Lobby" hint drawn in bottom-left corner of canvas

## 2026-03-24 — Session 5
- Added notebook object with 3 fixed spawn positions inside the floor
- spawnNotebook() picks one randomly each time START is clicked
- Notebook drawn as a small green rect (12×16) before the player
- Next: player pickup interaction with notebook, or ghost entity

## 2026-03-24 — Session 6
- Added notebook.found flag; resets on spawnNotebook()
- nearNotebook() checks distance < 40px
- E key sets notebook.found = true when close
- Proximity shows "Press E to inspect" hint; found dims the notebook and shows message
- Next: ghost entity (roaming, hidden)

## 2026-03-24 — Session 7
- Added ghostNames list (5 types) and currentGhost variable
- pickGhost() called on START; resets each round
- After notebook inspected, message shows "the ghost is a [name]"
- Next: ghost entity that moves around the room

## 2026-03-24 — Session 8
- Added exit zone (60×10px, bottom-center of floor); dim until notebook found, then lit yellow
- playerOnExit() checks AABB overlap; sets roundOver=true when triggered post-notebook
- drawResult() draws full-canvas result screen with ghost name
- ESC works from result screen too; roundOver flag reset on return
- Next: ghost entity, or sanity/threat system

## 2026-03-24 — Session 9
- Replaced ghostNames array with ghosts array: [{name, clue}, ...]
- 3 ghost types: Wraith, Poltergeist, Banshee — each with 1 text clue
- Notebook now shows clue text, not ghost name
- Result screen still reveals ghost name after escape
- Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md to reflect actual progress
- Next: ghost entity (roaming rect) or player guess UI

## 2026-03-24 — Session 10
- Added guessing state between exit and result
- drawGuess() shows clue + 3 ghost choices; 1/2/3 keys pick
- guessCorrect flag set; result screen shows correct (green) or wrong (red)
- ESC works from guessing state too
- Next: ghost entity (roaming rect on the floor)

## 2026-03-24 — Session 11
- Fixed loop: requestAnimationFrame now always fires (was returning early, breaking guess→result transition)
- Added selectGhost(index): shared path for keyboard and mouse
- Added canvas click listener: maps click to guessBoxes AABB, calls selectGhost
- guessBoxes array defines box rects shared by drawGuess and click detection

## 2026-03-24 — Session 12
- Added loopRunning flag; loop() only starts if not already running
- Fixes speed stacking caused by multiple loop() calls on repeated START clicks
- No other behavior changed

## 2026-03-24 — Session 13
- Title screen: added control cheatsheet and clearer loop description
- Game HUD: added live objective line (find notebook → reach exit)
- Proximity/clue text: centred, more descriptive
- Guess screen: footer hint updated ("abandon round")
- Result screen: ESC hint updated ("return to the lobby and play again")
- No logic changes

## 2026-03-24 — Session 14
- Added arrowKeys array; keydown calls e.preventDefault() for arrow keys only
- Objective text moved from y=68 (inside room) to bottom-right at x=790, y=590 (right-aligned)
- Updates dynamically: "find the notebook" → "reach the exit" after pickup

## 2026-03-24 — Session 15
- Added clue2 to each ghost object
- Added photo evidence: red 14×12 rect, 3 spawn positions, spawnPhoto() called on start
- nearPhoto() + E key interaction mirrors notebook pattern
- Photo dims to dark red when found
- HUD: notebook clue (green) and photo clue (red) stacked above bottom bar after discovery

## 2026-03-24 — Session 16
- Replaced ghost clues with overlapping set: Wraith+Poltergeist share clue1; Wraith+Banshee share clue2
- One clue alone leaves 2 candidates; both together uniquely identify each ghost
- No code changes except the ghosts array

## 2026-03-24 — Session 17
- Added journalOpen flag; reset in showGame()
- J toggles journal during gameplay; ESC closes it first before checking other states
- drawJournal(): semi-transparent overlay, shows found/missing clues, ghost list filtered by evidence
- Possible ghosts shown bold+white with ▶; eliminated ghosts dimmed with ✕
- update() skipped while journal is open (movement paused); draw() + drawJournal() still run

## 2026-03-24 — Session 18
- Added ROUND_TIME=90, timeLeft, lastTime, lostRound flag
- showGame() resets timer and sets lastTime = performance.now()
- update() computes delta each frame, subtracts from timeLeft; skipped while journalOpen
- Timer hits 0: gameRunning=false, lostRound=true
- drawLose(): red lose screen showing ghost name; ESC returns to lobby
- Timer drawn top-right: grey normally, red under 20s
- ESC now also clears lostRound

## 2026-03-24 — Session 19 — Plan update only
- Removed 90s lose-timer concept from PROJECT_PLAN.md and TASKS.md
- Replaced with safe-time window idea: ghost is passive at round start; danger begins after safe time ends
- Lose condition will come from ghost danger/hunt system, not a countdown
- Next: ghost entity (roaming rect), then safe-time + hunt system

## 2026-03-24 — Session 20
- Renamed ROUND_TIME/timeLeft to SAFE_TIME/safeTime; added safeTimeOver flag
- update(): ticks safeTime down; stops at 0 and sets safeTimeOver=true; no fail state
- HUD top-right: green "Safe: Xs" during safe period, red "Danger" after
- Journal open pauses safeTime tick (existing journalOpen guard in update())
- showGame() resets safeTime=20, safeTimeOver=false, lastTime=performance.now()
- Next: ghost entity (roaming, activates when safeTimeOver)

## 2026-03-24 — Session 21
- Renamed arrowKeys → movementKeys; added "w","a","s","d" to the preventDefault list
- Fixes WASD not working; arrow keys still blocked from scrolling
- No other changes

## 2026-03-24 — Session 22
- Added ghostFlash object {active, x, y, alpha, timer} and flashCooldown
- After safeTimeOver: flashCooldown ticks down; triggers flash at random floor pos every 5–10s
- Flash fades over 0.6s via alpha = timer/0.6; drawn as pale blue-grey rect (globalAlpha)
- showGame() resets ghostFlash.active=false, flashCooldown=6
- Next: ghost entity that roams and causes lose condition

## 2026-03-24 — Session 23
- Added ghost object {x, y, width:18, height:24, speedX:1.2, speedY:0.9, visible}
- showGame() places ghost at random floor position, visible=false
- update(): when safeTimeOver, ghost.visible=true; moves by speed each frame; bounces off floor edges
- draw(): ghost drawn as semi-transparent (alpha 0.45) pale blue-grey rect; distinct from flash
- Next: ghost hunt mode (chases player, lose condition)

## 2026-03-24 — Session 24
- Replaced single room/floor with rooms[] array (5 rooms) + doorways[] array + walkable[]
- canMoveTo(nx,ny): AABB overlap check against all walkable rects; includes wall sliding
- Player starts in foyer (175,160); exit moved to outside strip near van
- Evidence spawns updated to indoor-only positions (foyer, living room, kitchen, dining room)
- Ghost bounces in indoor bounding box (x:50-700, y:90-520)
- Ghost flash picks a random indoor room for its position
- draw(): background→rooms→doorways→labels→van→caution tape→exit→evidence→ghost→player→HUD
- Next: remaining rooms (hallway, bedrooms, basement) or ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 25

- Player starts in living room (360,310); ghost bounces in house bounds (100-640, 100-470)
- Removed van/caution tape draw; room labels now #555
- Next: add doorway rects to connect rooms

## 2026-03-24 — Session 41
- Walk-in Closet snapped to x:330, y:330, w:150, h:120 (flush between master bath east, hallway west, above living room)
- Walk-in connector updated: h:41→h:38 (gap is now standard 6px)
- Kitchen/Dining extended south: h:300→h:360 (bottom y:660→y:720) — breaks rectangular footprint

- Garage split: x:174 w:156 (main garage); Storage at x:120 w:54 h:150 (separated strip with one connector at x:155)
- Coat Closet slightly reduced to 72×72; Walk-in label shortened to "Walk-in"
- Removed house shell fillRect — walls[] array now defines all wall material explicitly
- Closet labels shortened to fit small rooms ("Closet", "Linen", "Walk-in")
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 39
- Kid BR1, Kids Bath, Kid BR2 shrunk from h:180 to h:120 (y:180-300)
- Added 6 new closet/storage rooms: Walk-in Closet, Coat Closet, Storage nook, BR1 Closet, Linen, BR2 Closet
- Added 5 new connectors (kids room→closet use standard h:38; master bed→walk-in and foyer→coat closet use h/w:41 due to 9px walkable gap)
- Garage Storage nook needs no connector — overlaps garage walkable rect directly
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 38
- Added walls[] array: 9 wall segments (outer perimeter + interior dividers)
- Wall color #1e1610 (darker than house shell #2a2018); drawn after shell, before rooms
- Visual/structural only — canMoveTo and walkable[] unchanged
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 37

- ctx.save() / ctx.translate(-camX, -camY) / ctx.restore() wraps all world draw calls
- HUD, debug legend drawn after ctx.restore() — screen-fixed
- No collision logic changed; all positions remain world coordinates
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 36
- Scaled entire house layout 1.5x: rooms, doorways, houseShell, player start, exit, notebookSpawns, photoSpawns, ghost spawn, ghost bounce bounds
- Player width/height/speed unchanged; collision logic unchanged; room relationships unchanged
- House now extends beyond 800×600 canvas — expected, no camera yet
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 35
- Added houseShell rect (x:80,y:80,w:520,h:460) drawn before rooms with fill #2a2018
- The 6px gaps between adjacent rooms now read as visible wall thickness (dark warm brown)
- Outside canvas remains #111 (black void); wall color is distinct from both void and floor colors
- No collision, room positions, or connector geometry changed
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 34
- Set DEBUG_COLLISION = false; overlay hidden, collision logic unchanged
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 33
- Recalculated all 11 connector rects for full-containment collision
- Cross-axis dimension: 14px → 38px (16px into each room + 6px gap)
- Side connectors: x -= 16; floor connectors: y -= 16
- Player (16×16) can now be fully inside a connector at every point during a crossing
- Next: verify traversal with debug overlay, then remove debug flag

## 2026-03-24 — Session 32
- Fixed canMoveTo: changed from AABB overlap to full containment check (nx >= r.x, nx+w <= r.x+r.w, etc.)
- Debug screenshots confirmed partial overlap was allowing movement outside walkable bounds
- Walls now solid immediately; player can only move when fully inside a room or connector rect
- Next: verify with debug overlay, then remove DEBUG_COLLISION

## 2026-03-24 — Session 31
- Added DEBUG_COLLISION flag and overlay: green=room walkables, cyan=connectors, red=player rect
- Overlay mirrors the exact rects used by canMoveTo so the debug view is ground truth
- Next: inspect overlay, confirm gap/bridge alignment, then fix or verify collision

## 2026-03-24 — Session 30
- Fixed wall pass-through properly: rooms shrunk 3px inward in walkable (6px total gap between adjacent rooms)
- Connectors widened to 14px (from 6px) — extend 4px into each room, bridging the 6px gap reliably
- Verified connector math: every connector overlaps both rooms it bridges with margin to spare
- Walls are now solid; only connector openings allow room-to-room movement
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 29
- Fixed wall pass-through: walkable room rects now shrunk 2px inward on all sides
- Adjacent rooms no longer touch in walkable space; connectors are the only bridges
- Drawn room rects unchanged (visual is identical)
- Next: ghost hunt mode

## 2026-03-24 — Session 28
- Populated doorways[] with 11 open-gap connector rects (6px overlap on shared edges)
- Connects: Garage↔Laundry, Laundry↔Foyer, Foyer↔Hallway, Hallway↔Master Bed, Hallway↔Living Room, Hallway↔Kids Hallway, Hallway↔Kitchen, Master Bed↔Master Bath, Kids Hallway↔BR1/Bath/BR2
- walkable[] already spreads doorways — no other code changed
- House is now fully traversable
- Next: ghost hunt mode (chases player, lose condition)

## 2026-03-24 — Session 27
